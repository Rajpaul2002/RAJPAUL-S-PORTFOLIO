<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Raj Paul Peela, a passionate and driven individual hailing from Visakhapatnam. I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from ANITS, achieving a CGPA of 8.29. Although my academic background is in Electrical Engineering, my passion for problem-solving and mathematics has led me to immerse myself in the world of technology.</p>

  <P>I have developed strong technical skills in languages and tools like Java, Python, C, SQL, Git, and GitHub. Currently, I am honing my expertise in Data Structures and Algorithms using Java, aiming to master this essential aspect of computer science.</P>
  
  <P>Beyond academics, I am an active volunteer in IEEE, the world’s largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for humanity. My involvement in IEEE has been extensive, with over 15 technical events organized during my college years. I’ve had the honor of representing my college at the IEEE PES Leadership Meet in Gwalior (2023) and representing India at the IEEE VTS Spring 2024 in Singapore. These experiences have taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, networking, time management, and efficiency.</P>
  
  <P>In addition to my technical and leadership endeavors, I have earned a golden badge in problem-solving using Python on HackerRank and an Elite certificate in Python for Data Science from NPTEL.</P>
  
  <P>When I’m not immersed in my work, I enjoy watching sci-fi and thriller movies, playing sports, and delving into the intricacies of the stock market and quantum physics.</P>
  
  <P>I’m excited to leverage my skills, leadership experience, and continuous learning mindset to make meaningful contributions and be part of something remarkable.</p>
